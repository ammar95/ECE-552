Design of a pipelined RISC microprocessor system with data cache using Verilog

This project was completed in 3 phases. In the first phase, the basic functionality of a simple RISC processor was implemented including 
various forms of operate, data movement and control instructions. In the second phase, pipelining was incorporated along with protection 
for data hazards using data forwarding and stalling logic. In the third phase, 2 way set associative data (LRU replacement policy) and 
instruction cache were incorporated along with multi cycle memory. The design was later synthesized using synopsys design vision.

Note: It was an academic project and code is only posted here for reference.
